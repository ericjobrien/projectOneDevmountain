## Description
HorrorScope is my first project for Devmountain.  I completed it at the end of foundations.  I created Horrorscope to celebrate Halloween since it is around the corner 
and to highlight a few interactive features.  This is a fun tool that takes in questions from users and returns a quote from a horror franchise character as an answer to the question.
Users also have the option of changing the theme of the website which adjusts a number of HTML elements. 
## Technology
- Vanilla Javascript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- AJAX/JSON
- Heroku

This website was built using vanilla javascript and node.js.  I used express.js on the server-side and AJAX/JSON on the front-end.  Further, this site is hosted on Heroku.  In my first project hosting on Heroku, I created a step-by-step guide on how to execute all the tasks.
